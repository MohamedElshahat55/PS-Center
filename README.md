## PlayStation Center Management System

While enjoying epic üéÆ PlayStation üéÆ sessions with my friends üòÑ at a local gaming hub üïπÔ∏è, I noticed they had a cool system to track the time spent on each gaming console ‚è±Ô∏è. Inspired by this awesome setup, I decided to create my own version, with extra features to make the experience even better ‚ú®. I proudly present the PS Center Server ‚Äì an API that helps you monitor and manage gaming sessions üïπÔ∏è, calculate playtime ‚è≥ on multiple devices, and offer cool extras like ordering snacks üçø and much more üöÄ!
